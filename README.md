# Sebmins.GitHub.io

After University I wanted to create a portfolio website, which exhibits all my projects inside and outside of Uni. However, I had hardly any HTML, CSS or JavaScript experience. 

After Uni I started on designing and developing my own website. Displaying all my work, skills and a timeline of the last 4 years. I used fontawesome.com to display some of the icons, but it didn’t have many, so I instead designed them myself in Adobe Illustrator. I used GitHub pages to host the website as all my projects were going to be uploaded onto GitHub as well.

As it was only a 1-page portfolio, I didn’t want to overdo it with JavaScript buttons. However, I still wanted to get some experience, in JavaScript so I made the colour scheme of the website change on every refresh. 

Not all my projects where available on GitHub. I had to find all the source files and create a new repository for each. I added a README.md for all the projects, adding images and gifs to give an oversight of the work.
